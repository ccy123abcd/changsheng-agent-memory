**Your agent's memory, decoupled from the model.** Switch models mid-project — DeepSeek today, MiniMax tomorrow, a local 27B next month — and your agent still knows who you are, what the rules are, and where work left off. Recovery reads **8,669 tokens** per session. Restoring all sixteen memory systems in full would cost **685,560** — the tiered read is **1.3% of a full restore, 98.7% less**.

Every new session feels like "day one at work"? Your agent doesn't know who you are, what the rules are, or where work left off — so you re-explain everything, and it still drops things.

ChangSheng hands your agent a **shift handover** before it starts working:

- **Always reads** the core layer — identity, rules, user profile, latest todos, latest work log (nothing important silently dropped)
- **Re-states your rules** every session (rules alignment) — the do's and don'ts you set stay loaded, and stay followed
- **Checks a change index** (auto-generated, hash-based) before re-reading secondary files — unchanged files cost ~0
- **Keeps a review ledger** — every always-read file carries a byte budget, a review date and an expiry action, so a stale rule is flagged instead of quoted as current
- **Finds the reason behind a decision** — one command searches todos, logs, notes and the archive for *why* something was decided, not just where a word appears
- **Defers everything else** until it is actually needed
- **One-line handover** — say "handover" at a task break; the next session picks up exactly there

**This release publishes the design, not just the scripts.** The method behind
ChangSheng — four layers, whose/when tagging, entry points with checks, budget
rules — is in [`references/memory-system.md`](references/memory-system.md). Copy
the shape into your own setup, with any file layout and any tool.

Measured on our own production system (on-disk, 2026-10-24): a session recovers in **8,669 tokens**. A full restore of all sixteen systems would cost **685,560 tokens** — **1.3% of that, 98.7% less**. Host-injected identity (e.g. Hermes) is counted separately (37,630 B) and never double-read.

### Why this changes your workflow: free context switches

Cheap, reliable recovery turns "start a new session" from a **lossy, expensive operation** into a **free, safe one**. You no longer have to stretch one session until the context breaks — you switch whenever it makes sense:

- task boundary reached? **Switch.** A fresh, clean context works better than a bloated one
- long-running project? **Switch at milestones** — each session resumes exactly where the last one left off
- context getting heavy? **Switch early** instead of waiting for compression to kick in

Every switch costs a few thousand tokens to recover instead of tens of thousands of re-explaining — so the optimal move shifts from "squeeze one session dry" to "cut at the cleanest seam". This is the pattern we run in production (dozens of sessions per day, cross-session handover as the default).

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. get the skill
git clone https://github.com/ccy123abcd/changsheng-agent-memory.git
cp -r changsheng ~/.claude/skills/          # or your agent's skills dir

# 2. cold start (no config needed — discovery finds your layout)
cd changsheng
python scripts/memory_index.py --list .   # optional: preview what discovery picks
python scripts/memory_index.py            # discover + write index (≈30s total)

# 3. (optional) tune — copy config.example.yaml → config.yaml (mode/roles/extras),
#    or edit .changsheng/discovery.json to override a discovered role

# 4. self-test
python scripts/memory_index.py --demo
```

### Make it automatic (3 lines, 3 platforms)

Paste the block in [`assets/agents-snippet.md`](assets/agents-snippet.md) into **your project's
instruction file** — `AGENTS.md` (or `.hermes.md` on Hermes if you use one). Hermes, OpenClaw and
DeepSeek Harness all load that file at session start, so recovery then runs by itself: no code, no
hooks, no config. No instruction file in your project? Then just say "recover memory" per session.

## Platform support

| Platform | How to use |
|---|---|
| **Hermes** (Nous Research) | Drop into the agent's `skills/` directory, then paste `assets/agents-snippet.md` into `.hermes.md` or `AGENTS.md` → recovery runs automatically. Hermes injects SOUL/MEMORY/USER itself, and the skill detects host-injected identity and skips duplicate reads (the host-injected case). |
| **ClawHub / OpenClaw** | Dual-compatible frontmatter (standard + `metadata.hermes`). Install into the skills directory or via your hub client. |
| **Claude Code / Cursor / Codex** | Copy the folder into the project or agent skills directory (`~/.claude/skills/`, etc.); instruct the agent to follow SKILL.md at session start. |
| **Any LLM, any OS** | Recovery logic is pure convention + one Python stdlib script — model-agnostic; Windows / macOS / Linux; no GPU. |

## Why not just another memory plugin?

Existing memory/marketplace skills are mostly about **storing** memories. Nobody solves **cheap, reliable recovery**:

- Naive recovery = re-read everything → 685,560 tokens per session; tiered recovery is 8,669
- "Trust the model to remember" = gamble → it forgets, and you don't know what it forgot

The missing piece is a **change index**: a daily hash pass that tells the agent *what actually changed* since the last session. With it, recovery is **neither expensive nor risky**. That index is what this skill automates (`scripts/memory_index.py`, pure stdlib, ~0 cost).

## Why is this free?
ChangSheng is the memory layer of the [Tianxuanjing agent system](https://aivaultpro.com) — a dozen-plus agents, dozens of sessions a day, in real production use. We open-sourced the method (MIT) because a memory system gets better the more people run it, and because we'd rather earn your trust than your license fee.

There's no upsell inside the skill. The paid side is the managed system: hosted agents, multi-agent orchestration, and an H5 dashboard — with your data backed up to your own cloud drive and portable at any time. Same memory, zero re-setup when you switch models.

## How it works

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["New session starts"] --> B["Read L0 must-read<br/>identity · rules · user profile · todos · latest work log"]
    B --> C{"Read change index<br/>memory_index.md (auto-generated)"}
    C -->|"✅ flagged as changed"| D["Read changed files in full"]
    C -->|"⏸ unchanged"| E["Index summary line only<br/>≈ 0 token cost"]
    D --> F["L2 on-demand<br/>consult detail docs only when a task needs them"]
    E --> F
    F --> G["Report recovery done:<br/>identity ✅ / changes ✅ / N todos"]
```

| Layer | Reads | When | Cost |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0 Must-read** | identity / rules / user profile / latest todos / latest work log | Every new session — reliability anchor | small & fixed |
| **L1 Conditional** | secondary files (roles, members, configs) | **Only if the auto-generated index flags a change**; otherwise just the index summary line | ≈0 ← savings live here |
| **L2 On-demand** | detail docs / history | Only when actually needed | 0 |
| **L3 Fallback** | whole corpus — keyword / full-text / semantic search | When the first three tiers miss | budgeted, with a timeout |

`scripts/memory_index.py` hashes every L1-tracked file (md5 + 24h freshness window) and writes a human-readable `memory_index.md`. No index → all-or-nothing. With an index → read the few files that changed.

> Honest numbers (measured on disk, 2026-10-24): 8,669 tokens per session vs 685,560 for a full restore of all sixteen systems — 1.3%, or 98.7% less. The ~46 MB of raw material in the store is not on the restore path and is counted in neither figure. Highest-value users: heavy multi-session automation (many sessions/day).

## v0.99 — memory that never gets lost, three ways

- **Memory ledger** (`scripts/memory_ledger.py`) — every long-lived memory carries four fields: why it exists, when it's reviewed, how long it lives, what happens at expiry. Hard budget cap (30 KB). Nothing rots silently; the check reports missing files, missing fields, overdue reviews, expired entries, and over-budget ledgers.
- **Provenance recall** (`scripts/recall.py`) — "why did we decide this?" answered in seconds, with file names and line numbers, across todos, logs, notes/decisions, and archives. Every surface reports even on zero hits (silence is never confused with not searched); all-four-empty is its own exit code, never confused with "didn't look."
- **The method, written down** (`references/memory-system.md`) — the full system: one home per fact, two orthogonal questions (whose × which time direction), an entry table for every event type, budget rules, honest-reporting discipline — and a section on what this method does *not* solve.

## Configuration (optional)

ChangSheng works with **no config** (auto-discovery). To tune, copy `config.example.yaml` → `config.yaml`:

- `mode` — `auto` (default, discovers your layout) / `manual` (explicit paths only) / `internal` (fixed-layout)
- `roles` — semantic roles → real files: `rules` / `identity` / `todos` / `journal` / `profile` (file or directory; a directory resolves to its newest `YYYY-MM-DD.*` file)
- `must_read_extra` — extra L0 files read in full every session
- `tracked_files_extra` — extra L1 files, change-tracked (path / display name / description)

Legacy 0.2.x `must_read`/`tracked_files` keys migrate automatically (kept as L0/L1 extras). Discovery output lives in `.changsheng/discovery.json` — override any role there.

Outputs: `memory_index.md` (readable) + `memory_index_state.json` (state — don't hand-edit).

## Usage protocol (start of every new session)

0. **Discover** — read `.changsheng/discovery.json` (or run `python scripts/memory_index.py --discover .` on first use); stat the stored paths — any missing source triggers re-discovery. Python unavailable? Use the manual fallback list in SKILL.md.
1. Read the L0 roles + `must_read_extra` — every one, no shortcuts (host-injected identity = skip the file probe).
2. Read `memory_index.md`:
   - ✅ new change → read that file in full
   - ⏸ unchanged → index summary line only
3. Consult L2 detail docs only when a task needs them.
4. **Rules alignment** — from the rules file just read, restate the imperative rules (do / don't) and write `.changsheng/rules.json` for the guardrail. Optional hard enforcement: wire `scripts/rule_gate.py` into a platform hook (Claude Code PreToolUse example in SKILL.md).
5. Report honestly with sources — list any role that came up empty; never claim a recovery that didn't happen.
6. Context gauge — report real usage % when the platform exposes it (Hermes `/status`, Claude Code `/context`); check at every visible reading, nudge when approaching a band (25–30 / 45–50 / 65–70 by default) as well as inside it, and **refresh `.changsheng/handover.md` before any nudge goes out** — the nudge is the ready signal (full band table in SKILL.md; **tune the lines via `nudge_thresholds` in config.yaml**, e.g. 30/50/70 → 35/55/75 for more headroom).
7. Handover — at any task break say **"handover"**: the agent writes `.changsheng/handover.md` from the template; the next session reads it first.

### The two new doors (0.99.0)

```bash
# ledger — the must-read layer as a budget with expiry
python scripts/memory_ledger.py --init     # build .changsheng/ledger.json from what was discovered
python scripts/memory_ledger.py --check    # missing files · incomplete rows · overdue reviews · stale rows · over budget
#   each row: why · review_by · max_age_days · action_on_expiry
#   hard byte budget 30000 (target 25000) — adding a row means naming a row that leaves

# recall — the reason behind a decision, across four surfaces
python scripts/recall.py "why we chose SQLite"
python scripts/recall.py handover --paths notes journal
#   surfaces: todos · journal · notes · archive; every surface is reported even with zero hits
#   exit 3 = nothing could be searched at all (never confused with "not found")
```

Both are pure stdlib, zero dependencies, offline. The ledger writes only its
own JSON file; recall writes nothing at all.

## Security

- Discovery scans candidate paths by name only (metadata — no content); the index reads and hashes only files you listed (roles + extras). Never writes your memory files themselves — its own outputs are `.changsheng/discovery.json`, index md + state json, plus three optional agent-maintained files: `.changsheng/ledger.json` (your review table), `.changsheng/rules.json` (extracted rules for the optional gate) and `.changsheng/handover.md` (one-shot handover note, deleted after being read)
- `recall.py` reads text files under the directories you point it at and prints matching lines back to you — it writes nothing and sends nothing
- Nothing leaves your machine — no remote install pipelines, no script-to-shell execution
- Python standard library only. PyYAML optional: when absent, a built-in fallback parser reads the config (nested `roles:`, extras, flat `role_*` keys) — no silent config loss

## FAQ

**Why do I keep getting nudged to start a new session?**
Context windows fill up as a conversation grows — replies slow down, early instructions get squeezed, and quality drops. ChangSheng's nudges (default lines at 30/50/70%) remind you *before* that happens, and every nudge is preceded by a refreshed `.changsheng/handover.md`, so switching loses nothing. Recovery after a switch costs about 8,700 tokens instead of tens of thousands of re-explaining.

**Can I change when I get nudged? Yes.**
Copy `config.example.yaml` → `config.yaml` and set `nudge_thresholds` to your own lines, e.g. `[35, 55, 75]` if you prefer more headroom before being reminded. The agent reads it at recovery and uses your lines instead of the defaults. (No config file? The 30/50/70 defaults apply.)

**A nudge said "Handover is ready" — do I have to do anything?**
No. The handover note was already written for you. Just start a new session (or say "handover" first if you want to add anything); the next session picks up exactly where you stopped.

**Does ChangSheng send my data anywhere?**
No. Everything is local — discovery is name-only, the index hashes files you listed, nothing is uploaded. See Security.

## Roadmap (managed edition)

- Auto user-profiling (preferences / habits)
- **0.99.0 — The design, published: `references/memory-system.md` (four layers, whose/when tags, entry points, budget rules) + `memory_ledger.py` (budget & expiry) + `recall.py` (reason-recall across four surfaces).**
- **1.0 = the write side closes the loop.** 0.99 ships the read side (recovery) plus the method; 1.0 is when a memory also *enters* the system without you writing it down: capture (facts, decisions, preferences) happens as you work, the ledger's expiry actions actually run, and the archived layer is searchable across machines. Concrete bar for 1.0: (a) a write-side capture path with a documented entry point for every event type, (b) the ledger's `action_on_expiry` executed by a real runner rather than only reported, (c) cross-machine recall over the archive, (d) the recovery-cost measurement re-run on the 1.0 build and published as a number. Until those four hold, the version stays 0.99 — 0.99 is not a placeholder for 1.0, it's a complete read-side skill.
- **0.6.0 — Dreaming (write side) + Chinese reachability lines** (2026-09-19)
- Cross-device sync + web console
- One-click deploy

**Don't want to self-configure?** The managed edition = zero-setup, full system, continuous updates. → [Managed edition: TBD]

## Going further

ChangSheng is the memory layer. [AI Vault Pro](https://aivaultpro.com) is the full system: your agents hosted and orchestrated, memory included, backed up daily to your own cloud drive — leave anytime and take everything with you. Switch models whenever you like; the memory stays.

Also by the same team: **Mode Switch Kit** — one command flips your whole machine stack (VPN, background agents, local services, model tier) from a single YAML mode matrix.




## Paid services (optional)

Everything in this repository is free (MIT-0) — use it, fork it, ship it. No purchase required, ever.

We also take on a small number of **managed edition** engagements for teams that want the whole system, not just the skill:

| | Free skeleton (this skill) | Managed edition |
|---|---|---|
| One line | Recover state before work starts, at ~1/3 the token cost | Memory that grows, cleans and indexes itself |
| Pain it fixes | A new session is amnesia — you re-explain everything | The more it remembers, the messier it gets; nothing gets written down |
| Read side (recovery) | ✅ four-layer + change index, 1.3% of a full restore | ✅ same, with thresholds tuned to your real volume |
| Write side (how memory gets in) | ⚠️ half — periodic tidy-up, triggered by you | ✅ automatic: facts, decisions and preferences captured as they happen |
| Handover | ✅ one command | ✅ handover + persistence + archive, nothing dropped |
| Rules | ✅ action-time gate (non-zero exit blocks the action) | ✅ plus tiered approval: small changes run, big ones get reviewed and verified |
| Knowledge base | ❌ not covered | ✅ four-layer sync, machine-checked |
| Multi-agent / multi-person | ❌ not covered | ✅ ownership matrix + dispatch / receipt / acceptance loop |
| What you get | a skill folder, works out of the box | a running system on your own machine (remote or on-premise) |

- **Full memory system rollout** — we connect the memory you already have (notes, chat logs, private files) and stand up a system on **your own machine** that grows, cleans and indexes itself. Deliverable: a running setup + an operations guide + one month of support.
- **Agent system build-out** — you provide a machine and one real use case; we build the whole stack (memory + role split + automation) until it runs. Deliverable: a running setup + an operations guide.
- **Short-term rental pricing & operations** — connect your listing data; we produce actionable pricing rules and a daily operations checklist. Deliverable: a rules document + first-month support.

We do not take: fully managed operations, revenue guarantees, or decisions made on your behalf. Pricing is quoted per engagement.

**Model requirements (managed edition):** a frontier cloud model — Claude Sonnet-class / GPT-4o-class / DeepSeek V3-class or better. Context window **64K tokens or more** (hard requirement). Small local models (7B–14B) and retired models are not supported.
